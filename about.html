         <p>Hi, my name is Jakob. I`m a self-taught tattooer and painter from Berlin, Germany.<br/><p/>

         <p>My style is very minimalistic and abstract, painting and tattooing stand in permanent exchange and depend on each other within my work.<br />
         My influences are different styles of fine arts such as abstract expressionism and constructivism but i get a lot of inspiration from graffiti tags and throwups as well.<br /><p/>

         The first time i held a tattoo gun in hand was when a group of friends gave one to me as a birthday present.<br />
         Back than i didn’t even have tattoos myself, <br />but in the punk and d.i.y. scene i come from, quite a lot of people own machines.<br/>
         Doing occasional home-tattooing sessions was (and still is) widely spread.<br />

         <p>It took some years to find the courage to start using the machine i got and the first "victims" were friends, who agreed to getting my drawings tattoed.<p/>
            <p>The whole thing became bigger and bigger quite fast and as i continued experimenting i found out that a lot of people like the idea of non-figurative tattoo motives, which are no tribals or patterns either.<b/>
